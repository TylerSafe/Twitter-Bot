# Twitter-Bot
Created by Tyler Safe in 2022

Description:

A bot that tweets @Dominos_AU every day at 6pm to put puff crust back on the menu using Google Sheets, Google Cloud Services (Cloud Functions + 
Cloud Scheduler), Twitter API, Twitter Developer Portal and gspread. The code does not contain any keys so will not run unless you add in your 
own, as the keys are private (obtained from twitter dev portal). This projectwas mainly created for educational purposes but is also something 
I feel strongly about. There is currently no plan for additional features besides the automated tweet, the rest of the account will be handled 
manually.
